                     ******************** Defender Moo: GameMaker ********************************


This Defender Moo game has undergone several changes  from the original game to improve the player experience
and enhance the game’s Theam's of protecting cows. There are some minor changes in
comparison to the original Defender game they are listed below:

Input structure:

        • Player Movement:
        I have set up some arrow keys to move the player's ship in the game. To move the
        player up and down you can press the up and down arrow keys and similarly, to move
        your player left and right you can press left and right keys.
        • Shooting:
        To shoot the enemies down hit the spacebar on your keyboard to shoot bullets! The
        bullets will travel straight in the player’s direction.
        • Pause:
        I have set the escape key to pause the game. If you need to take a break while playing
        you can always pause by hitting the escape key, there will be text on the screen that
        will show that the game is paused. additionally, you will see the menu on the screen
        that gives you a choice to jump on the main menu or quit the game menu.
        • Restart:
        To restart the game just simply press the R key on your keyboard it will take you to
        the men Manu.
        
Game Theme:

        The theme of this game is surrounded by the environment where there are some cows, enemies,
        and players. The goal of this game is to protect the cow from being kidnapped by alien ships.
        However, you get to score points by destroying the enemies and some bonus points if you
        successfully save the cows. This theme adds a unique and fun element to the game, making it
        more engaging for players.
        
Enemy type:

        There are two unusual types of enemies in the game. The first enemy is the kidnapper who
        tries to take a cow away. The second enemy is the distractor who makes smooth travel of our
        player, by getting in the way. The kidnapper enemy is present from the beginning of the
        game, while the distractor is introduced in the second round after the player has scored 800
        points. This change adds more variety to the gameplay and challenges players to adapt to
        diverse types of enemies


Storyline:

      The storyline of this Defender Moo game follows the adventures of a space farmer who is
      trying to protect his beloved cows from being kidnapped. This storyline adds depth to the
      game and gives players a sense of purpose as they try to save the cow.
      
Movement:
        
        • Player:
        
        The player’s moment mechanism is improved by making it smoother and more
        responsive with a little bit of lag when you change direction after high speed which
        makes it harder to control the players and adds a bit of difficulty to the game.
        
        • Cow:
        
        The cows can move only by Alien ships when colliding with them or when not
        colliding enemy and not colliding to the ground they can be picked up by our player
        and can be moved anywhere on the level and can be dropped off anywhere on the
        ground. When caught successfully player gets 300 points.
        
        • Kidnapper enemy:
        
        Kidnapper enemies can move from top to bottom when they are not holding any cow,
        if they pick up a cow they move upwards out of the screen. If the player collides with
        Kidnapper enemy ships our player ship gets destroyed. Upon destroying this enemy
        The player earns 100 points.
        
        • Distractor enemy:
        
        The distractor enemy always moves up and down and randomly moves in the x direction,
        making it hard for our layer to travel and save the cows. If the Distractor enemy collides
        with the player’s ship gets destroyed. Upon destroying this enemy Player earns 200
        points.
        
        Attack:
        
        The player can attack the enemy by hitting the spacebar which shoots bullets, and enemies
        get destroyed when colliding with the bullets.


Removed:

      The attack mechanism by the enemy has been removed it makes the game more balance.
      Players must focus on protecting the cow and avoiding enemies. This change simplifies the
      gameplay and makes it more approachable for all skill levels player.
      
Added:

      When you play the game there will be a Timer in each level 20 seconds for the first level and
      30 seconds for level 2, to clear level 1 you must earn 800 points and 2000 points to finish
      level 2, and to win the game you must finish both levels. To make this game more
      challenging I have set these points system so that you cannot clear a level without saving at
      At least one cow, especially in level 1.
